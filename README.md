# MultiplexShockCode
This is code to analyze how multiplex networks evolve after shocks.

We want to especially thank Paul Smaldino for creating the initial code we base our simulations on. Code is from paper:
Smaldino PE, Dâ€™Souza R, Maoz Z Resilience by structural entrenchment: Dynamics of single-layer and multiplex networks following sudden changes to tie costs. Network Science: 1-19. doi:10.1017/nws.2017.35 (2017).

Agents: This code is based on Paul Smaldino's code to simulate how multiplex networks evolve. More details are discussed in the README file in the Agents folder.

Analysis: This code analyzes the output of our simulations, and creates cleaned and more compact files we need to parse the data.
